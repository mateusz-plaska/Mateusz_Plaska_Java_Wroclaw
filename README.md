# Payment Method Selector

## üìå About the Project
**Payment Method Selector** is an application that optimally assigns payment methods (loyalty points and bank cards) to a list of grocery orders, maximizing total discounts. Each order is also assigned a 
selected subset of possible promotions associated with the payment method.

Each order can be paid:

- in full by one traditional payment method (e.g. one card),
- in full with loyalty points,
- partially with points and partially with one traditional payment method.

**Discounts**:
- If the **entire** order is paid with a **card** of a bank with which we have an agreement (such payment methods are specified in the list of available promotions for a given order ), the percentage discount specified in the definition of the payment method is calculated.
- If the customer pays at least **10%** of the order value (before the discount) with loyalty **points**, the store gives an additional discount of 10% on the entire order value.
- If the **entire** order is paid with loyalty **points**, apply the discount defined for the ‚ÄúPOINTS‚Äù method, instead of the 10% discount for the partial payment with points.
